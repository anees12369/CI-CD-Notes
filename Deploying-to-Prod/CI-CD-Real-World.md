**Automated testing and linting**
---
- **Linting and automated testing** help us catch errors early and keep our codebase clean and reliable.

- **Linting:** A process of analyzing your code for any **syntax errors, bugs, and deviations,** it's like having a spell checker for your code. 

- **Automated testing:** The practice of running tests on your codebase automatically to ensure it works as expected. It involves writing test cases/apps that **verify different parts of your code** and running these tests automatically every time you make changes to the code. (e.g. python unittests)

- **Tools:** ESLint, PyLint, Unittest, Pytest etc
