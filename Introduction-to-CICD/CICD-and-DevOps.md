# **DevOps Pipeline and CI/CD**

**1. Source Control**

- Developers store and manage code in systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

- Supports collaboration, version history, and conflict-free teamwork.

**2. CI/CD**

- Once code is in source control (and gets committed), CI/CD automates the build, test, and deployment processes.

- Ensures code is continuously integrated, tested, and delivered/deployed.

**3. Monitoring and Logging**

- After deployment, the application is monitored continuously for performance and errors.

- Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK help track issues and log events.

- Feedback from this stage can trigger fixes in code or CI/CD pipelines
